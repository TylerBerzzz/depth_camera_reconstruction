# Reconstructing a 3d model from a depth camera video stream 
Project intent: The goal is to repurpose an Intel RealSense 3D camera salvaged from a Naked Labs 3D scale and develop original software to recreate 3D images with dimensional accuracy. No reverse engineering of proprietary firmware or software is being conducted. This project uses only publicly documented hardware interfaces and self-authored code.

Using intel realsense D410 depth camera for 3d reconstruction.
